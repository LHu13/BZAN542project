```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```


Loads in the data and packages needed.
```{r}
#Change the working directory to your own.
setwd("C:/Users/liana/Downloads/archive")

#Loads in the required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

# Read in and combine the two .csv files containing the by-event damage data
csgo_data <- rbind(read.csv("esea_master_dmg_demos.part1.csv"), 
             read.csv("esea_master_dmg_demos.part2.csv"))
```

Finds the column names and how the games are grouped in the dataset.
```{r}

colnames(csgo_data)

files_names <- unique(csgo_data$file) #each file is a separate ESEA match with all of its associated data
```



Creates unique identities for each player in each match that stays through each round so we can document hp.
```{r}
player_round_map <- csgo_data %>%
                    select(file, round, vic_side, vic_id) %>%
                    distinct() %>% #eliminates repeats of the exact same row where rows are identical
                    group_by(file, round, vic_side) %>% #groups by the match, round, then victim side that was shot
                    mutate(pnumber = row_number()) %>% #makes a column called pnumber which is th row number
                    mutate(player_id = paste0(vic_side, pnumber)) %>% #combines the two string names together to make the names for the players
                    ungroup() %>% #ungroups items to delete stuff
                    select(-pnumber, -vic_side) %>% #deletes pnumber and vic_side columns because we have player_id now
                    spread(player_id, vic_id) %>% 
                    select(file,
                           round,
                           CounterTerrorist1,
                           CounterTerrorist2,
                           CounterTerrorist3,
                           CounterTerrorist4,
                           CounterTerrorist5,
